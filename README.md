# Graduate Developer Docker Project

As a graduate developer, I need to demonstrate my understanding of basic Docker concepts by creating, containerising, and running a simple Node.js script. I will also practice essential Docker CLI commands. I will submit a short Loom video walking through the demo to confirm I understand each step.

## Tasks

1. **Create a new local folder for the project.**
2. **Create a more advanced Node project with two Express servers.**
   - Connect them on the Docker network.
3. **Write a Dockerfile to containerise the script.**
4. **Build the Docker image locally.**
5. **Run the Docker container to verify it works.**
6. **Practice and demonstrate these Docker CLI commands:**
   - List images: `docker images`
   - List containers: `docker ps`, `docker ps -a`
   - Remove images: `docker rmi`
   - Remove containers: `docker rm`
7. **Record a Loom video walking through:**
   - Project structure
   - Contents of the Node.js script and Dockerfile
   - Building the image
   - Running the container
   - Using the listed CLI commands

THIS IS A TEST
