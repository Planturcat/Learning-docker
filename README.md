As a graduate developer, I need to demonstrate my understanding of basic Docker concepts by creating, containerising, and running a simple Node.js script. I will also practice essential Docker CLI commands. I will submit a short Loom video walking through the demo to confirm I understand each step.

Tasks

Create a new local folder for the project.

Create a more advanced node project with two express servers. We will then do the work to connect them up to each on the docker network.

Write a Dockerfile to containerise the script.

Build the Docker image locally.

Run the Docker container to verify it works.

Practice and demonstrate these Docker CLI commands:

List images (docker images)

List containers (docker ps, docker ps -a)

Remove images (docker rmi)

Remove containers (docker rm)

Record a Loom video walking through:

Project structure

Contents of the Node.js script and Dockerfile

Building the image

Running the container

Using the listed CLI commands
